2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
5. What are the six comparison operators?
6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

#Answers
1. The two values of the Boolean data type are True and False.
2. The three types of Boolean operators are AND, OR, and NOT.
3. Truth Tables for Boolean operators:
   AND:
     | A | B | A and B |
     |---|---|---------|
     | T | T | T       |
     | T | F | F       |
     | F | T | F       |
     | F | F | F       |

   OR:
     | A | B | A or B |
     |---|---|--------|
     | T | T | T      |
     | T | F | T      |
     | F | T | T      |
     | F | F | F      |

   NOT:
     | A | not A |
     |---|-------|
     | T | F     |
     | F | T     |

4. Results of expressions:
   (5 > 4) and (3 == 5) → False
   not (5 > 4) → False
   (5 > 4) or (3 == 5) → True
   not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) → False
   (True and True) and (True == False) → False
   (not False) or (not True) → True

5. The six comparison operators are: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

6. The equal to operator (==) compares values, while the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.

7. The three blocks are:
   Block 1: spam = 0
   Block 2: if spam > 5: (with else part)
   Block 3: print('spam')

8. Code:
   spam = 1
   if spam == 1:
       print("Hello")
   elif spam == 2:
       print("Howdy")
   else:
       print("Greetings!")

9. Press Ctrl + C to stop an infinite loop.

10. The break statement exits the loop entirely, while continue skips the current iteration.

11. In a for loop, range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) all produce the same output.

12. Programs for printing numbers from 1 to 10:
   For loop:
   for i in range(1, 11):
       print(i)

   While loop:
   i = 1
   while i <= 10:
       print(i)
       i += 1

13. If bacon() is in the module spam, use:
   import spam
   spam.bacon()
